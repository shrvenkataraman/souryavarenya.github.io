Although I have spent most of my life in Mumbai, I am a native speaker of Telugu (can read and write too!). I have had my hands into all random arts - Carnatic Vocal, Painting, Violin, Chalk and Pencil sculpting, 3D modeling etc. Being in the exploration phase, I am still attempting to widen my knowledge before I narrow down on one and go deeper.

As of now, I have graduated with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras. Four years at IIT Madras has been an amazing journey, making me realize several things about myself and how world works. Anveshak - the Mars rover design team has been my major investment during these 4 years and you can find more about it in "My Work" section.

Eventually, I wish to get into academia to nourish my passion for research and innovation. Practicing private research would be my future ambition but the feasibility is still in question.

Thanks for stopping by!
