I have been an active member of this team and I am currently presiding over the team. We had a successful maiden participation in the University Rover Challenge in 2017 in my tenure of being the head. I have worked in several sub-teams - Electronics division, Media and design, Chassis design and TeRA.

### Electronics team
*November 2015*

I began my work as an electronics engineer in late 2015. I was working on the main controller board of the rover and majorly focused on conceptualizing architecture for the controller board. Unfortunately I don't have pictures or records of this phase to illustrate my work.
This phase of being in the team facilitated accelerated learning and let me explore electronics to a great extent.

### Head, Control and Electronics
*August 2016*

With an ambition to build a new team and train them, we conducted a recruitment drive which helped us take in about 10-15 people into the team. I have been known for not being a soft guy to deal with. After painful efforts, I was fairly successful in establishing a direction for the electronics, for our _imaginary_ rover. Having to deal with people and getting them to do the job was a unique experience and helped me get some really good friends.

### Head, Chassis design
*January 2017*

It was just few months before the competition and we were stuck on the chassis design with an irresponsible _friend of mine_. Sounds like a complain but dealing with this was certainly a tough job and eventually,  as it got intolerable, it was time for me to take the job over and having been inclined towards mechanical design, I was motivated sufficiently to take it up for the team. I was decently exposed to the CAD software and I found Fusion 360 to be the most intuitive one. It took a rebellion to get the entire team to adopt Fusion 360 but it was all worth the efforts. I never gave up on endorsing it (I wasn't paid for that!). Then followed the 4 days during which I, along with a bunch of people, showered insane efforts on getting the first render of our Rover. I would like to credit a close brother of mine - Akshay Molawade, for a well-planned execution of the manufacturing in the coming months. We gave birth to a new design team that was just unstoppable.

### University Rover Challenge 2017, MDRS, Utah
*May 2017*

This was probably one of the most memorable trips I have had till date. We were a 11 member group participating in the competition for the very first time. Carrying Rover in our luggage and clearing the official procedures was certainly an exciting challenge to deal with. Below are few of the captured moments worth taking a look at.

### TeRA - Tele-operated Robotic arm
*Present*

I am currently investing most of my time on the development of a powerful robotic arm *TeRA* and below is a render of the same. we are currently in the manufacturing phase of it.

We are optimistic of our qualification in the 2018 edition of University Rover Challenge
